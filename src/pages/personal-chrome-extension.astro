    <h1>Privacy Policy for Personal Annotation Extension</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how your information is collected, used, and
      shared when you use our Personal Annotation browser extension.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Personal Annotation is designed with privacy in mind. We collect and
      process the minimum amount of data necessary for the extension to
      function:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Annotation Data:</strong> Text highlights and shapes you create on
        webpages
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Website URLs:</strong> The addresses of pages where you create annotations
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use the collected information solely to provide the core functionality
      of the extension:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To display your annotations when you revisit webpages</li>
      <li>To organize annotations by webpage in the annotation manager</li>
      <li>To enable editing and management of your annotations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where Your Data Is Stored</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>All data is stored locally</strong> on your device using your browser's
      built-in storage mechanisms. No data is transmitted to external servers, and
      we do not have access to your annotations.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your information with any third
      parties. Your annotations remain completely private on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Since all data is stored locally on your device, you maintain complete
      control over your information. You can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>View all stored annotations through the extension's interface</li>
      <li>Edit or delete individual annotations at any time</li>
      <li>Clear all annotations from specific pages</li>
      <li>Completely remove all data by uninstalling the extension</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Your annotation data is retained in your browser's local storage until you
      manually delete it or uninstall the extension. We have no ability to
      access or delete this data remotely.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since all data is stored locally on your device, security depends on your
      browser's built-in security mechanisms. The extension does not introduce
      additional security risks beyond those inherent in browser local storage.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in
      our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The
      updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date.
    </p>
